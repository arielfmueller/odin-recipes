        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon dried minced onion flakes</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Allow frozen bread dough to thaw in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight. Place dough in a large, lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a dish towel and place in a warm space until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours. Punch down dough</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet</li>
        <li>Roll dough into a 12x18-inch rectangle on the prepared baking sheet. Brush dough lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle with basil, onion flakes, and oregano. Layer with pepperoni to within 1/2 inch of the edges. Top with mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Beginning with the longest edge, roll dough into a thin cylinder and seal the seam. Brush with beaten egg</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cut into bite-sized pieces to serve</li>
    </ol>
